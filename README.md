# Platinum9

This is a quick and dirty theme meant to approximate (but not really be too pixel accurate) the MacOS 9 (or System 7) theme.

Place the folder NineIcons in ~/.icons (created the folder if it doesn't exists), same with the GTK theme, place it in .themes. 

For the fonts, place them in .fonts and update your font cache and you should be good to go.
